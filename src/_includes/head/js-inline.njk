{# Core inline JS placeholder.
   We intentionally avoid `{% js %}` / `{% getBundle %}` and `{% include "scripts/*.js" %}` here because
   those require shortcodes/plugins and include partials that are not guaranteed to exist in every
   consuming site environment (e.g., Cloudflare Pages).

   If a site needs inline JS in <head>, override this file at:
   `src/_includes/head/js-inline.njk`
